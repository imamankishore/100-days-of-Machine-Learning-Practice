# 100 Days of Machine Learning Practice

Welcome to my 100 Days of Machine Learning Practice challenge.  
This repository documents my daily learning journey through the core concepts, tools, and real-world applications of Machine Learning.

## Challenge Goal

- Practice ML for 100 consecutive days and doing forward
- Strengthen concepts with hands-on coding
- Build intuition through mini-projects and real datasets
- Track progress and reflect on learnings..

---

## Topics Covered (so far)
- Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)
- Model Evaluation Metrics
- Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods
- Unsupervised Learning (KMeans Clustering, PCA)
- Feature Engineering
- Perceptron

---

## Daily Structure
Each day's folder includes:
- Code notebooks (in Jupyter or Python)
- Visuals and outputs
